A better lightweight Lethal Company mod manager.

To make it work:
Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in a cmd window in the BetterLCMM folder
Open config.cfg and set your Lethal Company folder
Run main.pyw

If it does not launch or crashes, open a cmd window in the BetterLCMM folder and run ```./main.pyw``` and create a issue and attach the error and the line that caused it.

To install a mod you can either:
Download the mod ZIP file and put it in the mods folder, or;
Put the full dependency name of the mod (e.g. sunnobunno-YippeeMod not just YippeeMod) into the mods_to_install.txt file and they will all be installed next launch.
In both ways all dependencies will be automatically installed alongside it.

To edit a config file you must press "Update Selected Plugins" then "Save configs" then in the config folder there will be the configs for all the mods.
^ This is only required once when new mods are installed.
And then once you have made the modifications to the configs press "Update Configs".

**Clarification!**:
The Update Selected Plugins does not update the mods, instead it updates the actual mods in the bepinex folder to the ones that have been selected
